        <p> Early life <br>
            Pei was born in 1989 in Beijing, China; his family soon moved to the United States, and then to Sweden,
            where Pei grew up.[4] He pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in 2008 at the Stockholm School of Economics,
            but he dropped out in 2011 to work full-time in the Chinese smartphone industry.[5][6]
            <br>
            Career
            <br>
            Pei joined Nokia in 2010, and he worked at the company for three months. After Nokia, the fan website Pei
            had created about Meizu had caught the attention of that company's Hong Kong branch, and Pei started working
            in Meizu's marketing team in 2011. In November, he joined Oppo as its international markets manager, where
            he worked directly under Pete Lau.[5][7][8]
            <br>
            OnePlus <br>
            Pei co-founded OnePlus with Pete Lau in Shenzhen, Guangdong in December 2013.[9] Their first device, the
            OnePlus One, sold close to a million units in 2014, despite a sales target of only 50,000.[10] In July 2015,
            Pei presented the OnePlus 2 through a virtual reality video on YouTube. It was claimed to be the first
            product launch in virtual reality, and it has been viewed over 304,800 times as of August 2022.[11] After
            the unveiling of the OnePlus 3 in June 2016, Pei claimed it was the company's most popular smartphone, based
            on the Net Promoter Score.[12] When asked in November 2016, Pei said the reason for the upgrade after only
            three months was because they did not want to wait to improve the hardware.[13] Pei claimed the OnePlus 5 to
            be their fastest-selling device to date shortly after its release in June 2017.[14]

            Pei oversaw the design and marketing of OnePlus devices until leaving the company in October 2020.[15]
